          <img src="/assets/about3.jpg" alt="Vision" />
          <div>
            <p>The journey of Nyaatha Plaza began with a bold vision‚Äîto create a modern, multi-purpose space that fosters business growth, hospitality, and community development in Nyeri. The project was spearheaded by Archbishop Anthony Muheria, whose leadership and dedication to sustainable development have been instrumental in bringing this vision to life.</p>
            <p>Construction commenced in December 2022, under the expert hands of Endeavours Construction Company Ltd, with architectural design by Skan Consult. In just 17 months, the project was completed, and on May 1, 2024, Nyaatha Plaza was officially inaugurated by Archbishop Hubertus van Megen, the Apostolic Nuncio to Kenya and South Sudan.</p>
            <p>Named in honor of Blessed Irene Stefani (Nyaatha), this plaza stands as a beacon of progress, service, and excellence, reflecting the compassionate legacy of the beloved missionary who dedicated her life to the people of Nyeri.</p>
